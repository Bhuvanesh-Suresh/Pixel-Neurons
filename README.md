# AI-Powered Healthcare Solution for Traveling Doctors

## Overview
This repository contains the complete implementation of an AI-powered healthcare solution designed to assist traveling doctors working in rural and underserved areas. The solution addresses challenges such as inconsistent patient care, lack of centralized health records, and resource limitations, offering tools for accurate predictions, medication recommendations, and patient data management.

---

## Proposed Solution
The solution leverages AI-driven tools to:

1. **Predict Chronic Conditions:** Models trained for diabetes, blood pressure, heart disease, and fever provide accurate and actionable predictions.
2. **Provide AI-Driven Recommendations:** A medical chatbot offers medication guidance and health insights.
3. **Manage Patient Data:** Longitudinal data tracking and secure storage ensure comprehensive patient care.

**User Flow:**
1. Doctors input patient data via a mobile/web app.
2. The system processes data through predictive models.
3. Results and AI-generated recommendations are displayed.
4. A chatbot assists in medication and healthcare advice.
5. Patient history and insights are stored for future reference.
